# Basic Machine Learning Examples
In this repo you can find code of my first machine learning project: predicting recurrence of strokes at the department of Neurology. Everyone can use this code for his/her own projects, as I hope it will save everybody some time and understanding as to how to develop a machine learning model.

Index of the code to topic:
